## Money

Money is an item and verifiable record that is generally accepted **based on trust** as payment for goods, services and repayment of debts with distinguished functions **of medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and a standard of deferred payment.**

**“Any item of verifiable record that fulfils these functions based on trust can be considered as money”**

**Money is a decaying item (the rate of decline in the value) due to inflation. Inflation is a general rise in the price level in an economy over a period.**

Money as a medium of exchange for goods and services. [Deposit accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account "Deposit account") are a form of [liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liability_(financial_accounting) "Liability (financial accounting)"). Liabilities are obligations or promise to provide services. [Interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest "Interest") are a [payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment "Payment") for a liability. Payments are made by providing services. Money is created when promises to provide services are made. Money is destroyed when promised services were provided. Money to pay for interests is created by promising to provide services. The below attributes help us distinguish among five different means of payment: (1) central bank money; (2) crypto-currency; (3) b-money, which currently is issued by banks; (4) electronic money, or e-money, offered by new private sector providers; and (5)i-money, short for investment money, issued by private investment funds.

The ratio of the total money added to the money supply (in this case, $1,000,000) to the total money added originally in the monetary base (in this case, $100,000) is the [money multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier "Money multiplier"). In this context, the money multiplier relates changes in the [monetary base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base "Monetary base"), which is the sum of [bank reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_reserves "Bank reserves") and issued currency, to changes in the [money supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply "Money supply").

Cash (notes and coins) accounts for only 3% of the money in circulation, whilst the remaining 97% of the money in circulation within the United Kingdom economy comprises of credit money that has been created by banks. [(Ryan-Collins, Greenham, Werner, & Jackson, 2011)](https://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/archive/starkey_banking#ryancollins).

Bank deposits account for approximately 97% of the money supply in the United Kingdom economy. Bank deposits are sometimes referred to as ‘credit money’, because the majority of bank deposits were originally created by banks issuing new loans. **A bank creates credit money when generating a bank deposit that is a consequence of fulfilling a loan agreement, extending an overdraft facility, or purchasing assets**. Credit money represents the total amount of money that is owed to banks by borrowers. The term credit money is a consequence of commercial bank’s IOU (abbreviated from the phrase "I owe you" is an informal document acknowledging debt) only remaining valid whilst the bank remains solvent. Bankruptcy of a bank would destroy a significant proportion, if not all, of the credit money created by a bank. The credit money component of money supply is reduced when money borrowed from a bank is repaid.

Bank deposits represent an IOU between a commercial bank and their customers, with customers including both individuals and organizations. Bank deposits can take a variety of forms, including current and deposit accounts. However, the government guarantees through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme the first £85,000 of an individual’s bank deposits, which can be considered to be money due to the government guaranteeing repayment of the money. Therefore, the term **credit money** only strictly applies to the amount of an individual’s deposits with a bank that exceeds the £85,000 limit of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

## Money Supply

The term "money supply" commonly denotes the total, safe, [financial assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_asset "Financial asset") that households and businesses can use to make payments or to hold as short-term investment. The money supply is measured using the so-called "[monetary aggregates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_aggregates "Monetary aggregates")", defined in accordance to their respective level of [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity "Liquidity"). In the United States, for example:

-   **M0**: The total of all physical currency including coinage. M0 = [Federal Reserve Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Note "Federal Reserve Note") + [US Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Note "United States Note") + [Coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_United_States_dollar "Coins of the United States dollar"). It is not relevant whether the currency is held inside or outside of the private banking system as reserves.
-   **M1**: The total amount of M0 (cash/coin) outside of the private banking system plus the amount of [demand deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_deposit "Demand deposit"), [travelers checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_cheque "Traveler's cheque") and [other checkable deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiable_Order_of_Withdrawal_account "Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account")
-   **M2**: M1 + most [savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account "Savings account"), [money market accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market_account "Money market account"), retail [money market mutual funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market_fund "Money market fund"), and small denomination time deposits ([certificates of deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit "Certificate of deposit") of under $100,000).

The money supply is understood to increase through activities by government authorities, by the central bank of the nation, and by commercial banks.

The different types of money are typically classified as "**M**"s. The "M"s usually range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest) but which "M"s are actually focused on in policy formulation depends on the country's central bank. The typical layout for each of the "M"s is as follows:

|Type of Money|M0|MB|M1|M2|M3|MZM|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Notes and coins in circulation (outside Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions|  ✓  | ✓  | ✓  |  ✓ | ✓  | ✓  |
|Notes and coins in bank vaults (vault cash)     |   | ✓  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |
|Federal Reserve Bank credit (required reserves and excess reserves not physically present in banks)
   |   | ✓  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

-   **M0**: In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, M0 includes bank reserves, so M0 is referred to as the monetary base, or narrow money.
-   **MB**: is referred to as the [monetary base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base "Monetary base") or total currency. This is the base from which other forms of money (like checking deposits, listed below) are created and is traditionally the most liquid measure of the money supply. Central bank money is **MB**
-   **M1**: Bank reserves are not included in M1.
-   **M2**: Represents M1 and "close substitutes" for M1. M2 is a broader classification of money than M1. M2 is a key economic indicator used to forecast inflation.
-   **M3**: M2 plus large and long-term deposits. Since 2006, M3 is no longer published by the US central bank. However, there are still estimates produced by various private institutions.
-   **MZM**: Money with zero maturity. It measures the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand. [Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money "Velocity of money") of MZM is historically a relatively accurate predictor of [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation").

The ratio of a pair of these measures, most often M2 / M0, is called an (actual, empirical) [money multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier "Money multiplier").
