### Introduction to Microsoft365

Microsoft 365 is a SaaS bundle of Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security that businesses can subscribe. There are three versions of Microsoft 365.

- Microsoft 365 Education, solution for educational providers.

- Microsoft 365 Business, solution for smaller business for up to 300 users.

- Microsoft 365 Enterprise, which is a complete solution for larger organizations.

A SKU is a stock keeping unit, which is useful for inventory management or in other words, a specific version of a product. The three SKUs available with Microsoft 365 are the Microsoft 365 Education, Microsoft 365 Business, and Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

[**Microsoft 365 Education**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-education) is a solution for education providers such as colleges. It includes the core components of Office 365 Education, Windows 10 Education, and Enterprise Mobility and Security, where they're offered as the A3 versions, which have fewer tools and solutions. The educational version includes some special additions, such as Minecraft Education Edition, which is aimed at promoting teamwork and creativity, and Microsoft Intune for Education, which includes some wizard-based tools to help institutions manage their classroom IT assets.

[**Microsoft 365 Business**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business#compareProductsRegion) is a solution for small and medium sized businesses for up to 300 users. It includes the business versions of Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security, and provides a Windows 10 business license upgrade if you already have Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8.1 Pro, or Windows 10 Pro licenses. Many of the special business features and products included in the Business SKU are aimed at enabling smaller businesses who may not have an IT department to easily move to the cloud. Included are many business-focused applications, such as MileIQ for mileage tracking, Invoicing for your billing and payment, and Bookings, which offers an online booking system for your customers to make appointments.

[**Microsoft 365 Enterprise**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans), is a complete solution of cloud services and applications for organizations of any size. There is an E3 and an E5 subscriptions in Microsoft Enterprise. The E5 versions of these products offers the most comprehensive set of services and tools, particularly in terms of security and analytics.

It also includes other services, including Microsoft Cloud App Security, Customer Lockbox, MyAnalytics and Advanced Data Governance. Both of these SKUs also include on-premises server rights for SharePoint, Exchange, and Skype for Business.

If you need a service that is not included in your original SKU, you can always purchase just that one service as an add-on to an existing plan. For example, you can add Security, Analytics, and Voice functionality, and Advanced Compliance or Power BI Pro. With Microsoft 365 you can scale quickly and easily shrink or grow as your business needs change. To scale your Microsoft 365 for extra users or services, simply purchase additional licenses. Microsoft will immediately provide the cloud infrastructure and will manage the increased resource requirements. If you need to store extra data, there is no additional costs, as this is all included within the fixed monthly subscription.

We'll be focusing on Microsoft 365 Enterprise.

### Other Microsoft 365 services

Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, and Enterprise Mobility and Security, are the core services offered with a Microsoft 365 subscription. These services allow devices and applications to be deployed, managed, and protected. However, there are other services included with a Microsoft 365 subscription, that help provide authentication and analytical functionality. Azure Active Directory, or Azure AD, is the cloud-based authentication and identity service which manages user identities and provides access controls for all Microsoft 365 services and applications.

### Collaboration with Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 has been designed to provide better integration between multiple Microsoft services. This enhanced integration provides businesses with improved collaboration functionality allowing users to work together in a more productive way. The mobile device management services offered by Intune allow users to be connected on the go, able to access corporate information no matter where they're located. Collaboration is where two or more people work together on a specific task or project. Team members collaborate to suggest ideas, and provide solutions. With Microsoft Whiteboard, a digital canvas, collaborate on ideas at work with Whiteboard for the web, integrated with Microsoft Teams. With Microsoft SharePoint online Share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to empower teamwork, quickly find information, and seamlessly collaborate across the organization. Both Teams and SharePoint team sites are organized by topic, project, organization, or some other focal point for a team of people. Hence, in any given organization, Teams and channels will often follow a similar structure to SharePoint team and project sites. In fact, this is inherent in the design. Every Microsoft Team automatically has a modern SharePoint team site associated with it; that's where channel documents are stored. Each channel is associated with a folder in the SharePoint site's document library. In addition, files sent between users outside of a Teams channel are stored in the sender's OneDrive for Business folder. Microsoft SharePoint integrated with Microsoft Teams assist team members run projects more smoothly. In this way information on best practice can be shared and workloads can be distributed amongst team members, tagged in tasks to individual skills.  There are several other collaboration tools included with Microsoft 365. These tools bring together the resources required by a team allowing them to work better together. These include, communication services with online meetings delivered from the cloud, using Microsoft Teams (replacing Skype for Business online), which can share calls, notes, files and images. You also have outlook for emails including shared inboxes, and resources such as conference rooms. You also have leadership connections providing a single solution for communication and engagement using Yammer, Office 365 and Microsoft Teams. Also learning and sharing, this is where you can crowdsource knowledge. Share best practices and information within your organization using SharePoint Online team sites. Emailing services with Exchange Online, which provides email and calendaring services for Office 365 ProPlus to share data, and arrange meetings and group events, and document storage within OneDrive for Business. Providing secure Cloud based storage accessible from anywhere across multiple platforms, which is shareable with others. Office 365 ProPlus is included with Microsoft 365. However, from time to time you may need to share or work together on documents with external collaborators who may not have access to the Office Suite of applications. To enable these collaborations Microsoft offer, Office on the web. Which includes free versions of the Office apps, which can be accessed online from anywhere by anyone. These are cut down versions of the full Office apps, so not all functionalities are available. However, they are a great resource for collaborative projects. Multiple people can use the same document at the same time, and input concurrently. You can also switch from working with the online version to the desktop version easily.

### Enterprise mobility

Enterprise Mobility allows employees to work from anywhere in the world using a variety of mobile devices such laptops, smartphones, and tablets. You can use Mobile Device Management to manage, control and secure your devices, applications, and data. Microsoft 365 includes Microsoft Intune. Intune allows you to manage iOS, macOS, Android, and Windows devices, such as Windows 10 PCs. You can enroll Apple devices, Android devices, and Windows devices, and even automate Windows deployment with Windows Autopilot. With software updates, you can deploy Windows updates, such as quality and feature updates to your remote devices. Once devices are enrolled into Intune they can be fully managed. This includes device configuration, where we can configure the behavior of devices by establishing rules and requirements, which is enforcing passwords on devices, implementing device encryption, and restricting the versions of the operating system on a mobile device allowed to access corporate data. Conditional access, we can use conditional access with device policies to block access for devices which do not meet your policy rules. And Microsoft Intune can be used to deploy, update, and manage your applications. Protection is critical for corporate data which needs to be protected from loss, corruption, leaks, and theft. That protection policies can be used to protect the access and security of data within apps such as your corporate email. Policies allow you to block app functionality. For example, restricting cut, copy, and paste within an app, requiring encryption, and preventing functionality such printing of organizational data. These policies allow you to manage app access and control which applications can be used on managed devices.

### Microsoft 365 analytics

Analytics provides you with the ability to perform data interrogation. It allows patterns within information to be discovered and interpreted. You can then make business decisions based on these analytics. For example, discovering that one specific product in the warehouse is not selling very well and yet it occupies a lot of space, allows stock levels to be managed differently. There are a number of analytics tools and apps included with Microsoft 365. Within your Microsoft 365 subscription, on the Office 365 dashboard, you can see the common apps on the right-hand side. When you click all apps, we can see a multitude of different apps which you may not be familiar. Let's review some of the analytics-related apps here. First, My Analytics.

The last tool I'll cover is Power BI. Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool. It brings together unrelated sources of business data across an organization and then analyzes the data and collates it into live dashboards and reports. Let's take a look. At Power BI home page there are number of favorites and projects. These are organized into workspaces. We can see Power BI dashboards and open them. This live dashboard allows us to interrogate it. It includes visualizations. These are charts, maps, and graphs which represent the data. We also have access to data sets where we can create new visualizations and also look at quick insights related to a set of data. We can access reports, which are a collection of visualizations on one page, which allows to share visualizations and reports. And tiles which are a single visualization as found within a report or dashboard.
