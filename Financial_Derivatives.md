## What is a Financial Derivative 
 
A financial derivative is an economic contract whose value depends on or is derived from the value of another
instrument or underlying asset. So a derivative is not a security like a stock or a bond where you have ownership in a company or have lent money to a company. A derivative is simply a side bet with another party on how a different security will perform. These derivatives are not issued by companies the way stocks and bonds are. They don't raise money for companies the way an IPO or a bond offering does. They are simply a side bet on how another financial product will perform and they derived
their price from that financial product which referred to as the underlying asset or underlying. Derivatives are often broken down or categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative. 

Things like 

 - Forwards and Futures
 - Options
 - Swaps

They can also be broken down by the type of underlying asset. Things like 

 - Equity derivatives, 
 - Foreign exchange derivatives, 
 - Interest rate derivatives, 
 - Commodity derivatives 
 - Credit derivatives. 

Finally they can be broken down by the market in which they trade. Things like 

 - Exchange-traded derivatives
 - Over-the-counter derivatives
 
Derivatives can be used for the purpose of speculation or for hedging. 
A ***speculator*** is a trader who's taking position
with the goal of making a profit. 

A ***hedger*** is a trader who already has an economic exposure and who takes an offsetting position in order to reduce a risk that they already have exposure to.

Often people are a bit confused by the term hedging they think it relates to the idea of a hedge fund. A hedger is not a hedge fund. It's simply a person who is trading a
financial instrument in order to reduce their risks. They are hedging their risk that are already exposed to a
financial risk. Their trading activity reduces that risk exposure. 

There are a number of underlyings for derivatives available and new ones are being developed all the time.
Some of the most popular underlyings are:
*Equities* which are also known as stocks which are listed on public exchanges companies like Apple, GE, Tesla, Verizon etc.  
Then there are fixed income derivatives like government *bonds*, corporate bonds, credit spreads, baskets of mortgages etc. We also have things
like *commodities* like gold, silver, cotton,
electricity etc. Then we also have *indices*
and *foreign exchange* which are popular
underlyings for derivatives. There are
even derivatives that pay off on things
like weather events. 

## Who Trades Derivatives

Let's talk about is who trades derivatives. Lots of people trade derivatives.  They are often break down into different groups like hedgers, speculators, arbitrageurs and middleman. 

***Hedgers*** are often producers or consumers of an underlying. They are required to typically have exposure to a particular underlying in the normal running of their business. Derivatives allow the risk related to the price of
the underlying asset to be transferred from one party to another. For example a corn farmer and the breakfast cereal manufacturing company like Kellogg's could enter into a futures contract to exchange a specified
amount of cash for a specified amount of corn at some point in the future. In doing so both parties will have reduced a future risk and thus both would be considered hedgers. Both parties reduce their exposure to certain variations in the price of corn which could materially
affect their respective businesses. Essentially what we've got in that case is it's really just that they fixed a price
in advance for a trade that they'll be doing at some point in the future. 

***Speculators*** are individuals who seek exposure to risky assets with the aim of making a profit. They're often
things like pension plan managers, insurance companies are asset management firms. Financial speculation can involve trading like buying holding or selling and short selling stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, real estate, derivatives or any valuable asset to attempt to profit from fluctuations in its price. Irrespective of its underlying value. Many try to differentiate the concept of speculation from investing. But for our purposes a speculator and an investor are individuals or companies who take a derivatives position with the goal of
profiting from it rather than with the goal of reducing their risk or hedging their exposure. 

***Arbitrageurs*** arbitrage is the practice of taking
advantage of a price difference between two or more markets. It usually involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset. The profit being the difference
between the market prices. Arbitrage is a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or extremely similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies. It provides a mechanism to ensure that prices do not deviate substantially from
fair value for long periods of time. The term arbitrage in  academics is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and the positive cash flow in at least one state. In simple terms that means it's the possibility of a risk-free profit at zero costs. It's an important idea in pricing derivatives. The key idea being that any two assets with the same cash flows and risk should have the same price.

Next let's discuss about  ***middleman*** who are the final group of market participants in the derivatives market. They're usually investment banks, market makers,
brokers. They trade derivatives with the goal of earning a commission or a bid-ask spread between customers who are undertaking opposing positions. These market participants typically are not aiming to accurately predict or profit from movements in the price of the underlying. They just aim to profit from the commission or spread that they get to charge their customers while in the ordinary running of their business middlemen can sometimes end up
holding a position which might cause a
profit or loss they typically doing to
avoid this though and will usually hedge
any residual exposures they're left with
if at all possible middlemen benefit
from churns so they really like a lot of
activity in the markets rather than
benefiting from actual accurate
predictions of price changes so chances
are if you made it this far in the video
you've found it at least a little bit

I'm gonna make a whole series of these

derivatives available to investors and
learn a little bit about the economic
function of the derivatives markets see
